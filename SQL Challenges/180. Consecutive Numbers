SQL Schema
Table: Logs

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| num         | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key for this table.
 
Write an SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example:

Logs table:
+----+-----+
| Id | Num |
+----+-----+
| 1  | 1   |
| 2  | 1   |
| 3  | 1   |
| 4  | 2   |
| 5  | 1   |
| 6  | 2   |
| 7  | 2   |
+----+-----+

Result table:
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+
1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.



Solution:

# Write your MySQL query statement below
With Consecutive AS (
SELECT Num,
LEAD(Num, 1) OVER() AS Next_1,
LAG(Num, 1) OVER() AS Prev_1
FROM Logs
)

SELECT DISTINCT Num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM Consecutive
WHERE Num = Next_1 AND Num = Prev_1
